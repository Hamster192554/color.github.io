The project is about color theory and finding the emotional patterns from it (Hammad Can Explain more).

the current index.html file contains the image of a color bar that has all the color value. Above it is the canvas where all the magic
is going to happen.
I am fetching the color from the bar and applying the hue, saturation for the bottom two bar, and then providing the option to
select the color.
To provide the mixing of color I can't think of a proper idea, however I have made the drawing.html file which provides the
color mixing ability but its a with overlap.
